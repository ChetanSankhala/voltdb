# SimpleSSL Application

This example application demonstrates how to configure and run VoltDB with SSL. 

Clients represent referees of a sporting event where individual athletes are scored from 0 to 10. Once each "referee" is authenticated, they submit scores for each athlete and print the results thus far.

The "SimpleSSL" application is not designed for performance assessments. SSL support is present in the "Voter" and "VoltKV" examples, both of which provide benchmarking applications.


Quickstart
---------------------------
Make sure "bin" inside the VoltDB kit is in your PATH.  Then open a shell and go to the examples/voter directory, then execute the following commands to start the database:

    voltdb init
    voltdb start

Wait until you see "Server completed initialization."
Open a new shell in the same directory and run the following to load the schema:

    sqlcmd < ddl.sql

In the same shell, run the following script to preload some data and run the demo client application:

    ./run.sh client

Open up the index.html file the "web" directory to view the status dashboard.

If you're running the example on a VoltDB cluster, rather than your local desktop or laptop, run `./run.sh webserver` in a new shell on one of the machines in the cluster, then connect to your dashboard from your browser at [http://servername:8081](http://servername:8081).

You can stop the server, running client, or webserver at any time with `Ctrl-c` or `SIGINT`.  Of course VoltDB can also run in the background using the -B option, in which case you can stop it with the `voltadmin shutdown` command.

Note that the downloaded VoltDB kits include pre-compiled stored procedures and client code as jarfiles. To run the example from a source build, it may be necessary to compile the Java source code by typing "run.sh jars" before step 3 above. Note that this step requires a full Java JDK.


Configuration
---------------------------

Many attributes of the application are customizable through arguments passed to the client. These attributes can be adjusted by modifying the arguments to the "client" target in run.sh.




Using the run.sh script
---------------------------
VoltDB examples come with a run.sh shell script that simplifies compiling and running the example client application and other parts of the examples.
- *run.sh* : start the server
- *run.sh server* : start the server
- *run.sh init* : compile stored procedures and load the schema and stored procedures
- *run.sh jars* : compile all Java clients and stored procedures into two Java jarfiles
- *run.sh client* : start the client, more than 1 client is permitted
- *run.sh clean* : remove compilation and runtime artifacts
- *run.sh cleanall* : remove compilation and runtime artifacts *and* the two included jarfiles

If you change the client or procedure Java code, you must recompile the jars by deleting them in the shell or using `./run.sh jars`.

Client Behavior Options
---------------------------
You can control various characteristics of the demo by modifying the parameters passed into the java application in the "client" function of the run.sh script.

**Speed & Duration:**

    --displayinterval=5           (seconds between status reports)
    --warmup=5                    (how long to warm up before measuring
                                   benchmark performance.)
    --duration=120                (benchmark duration in seconds)
    --ratelimit=20000             (run up to this rate of requests/second)

**Cluster Info:**

    --servers=$SERVERS            (host(s) client connect to, e.g.
                                   =localhost
                                   =localhost:21212
                                   =volt9a,volt9b,volt9c
                                   =foo.example.com:21212,bar.example.com:21212)

**Parameters Affecting Simulation:**

    --contestants=6               (number of contestants to vote on)
    --maxvotes=2                  (max votes per phone number)
    --threads=100                 (number of parallel client threads [only in sync or jdbc])

Customizing this Example
---------------------------
To further customize the cluster, see the "deployment-examples" directory within the "examples" directory. There are README files and example deployment XML files for different clustering, authorization, export, logging and persistence settings.
